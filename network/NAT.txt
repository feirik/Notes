The purpose of NAT is to translate private IP addresses to global IP addresses used for communicating on the internet.

NAT is set up on the router.

Private IP address ranges:
10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

NAT also helps in reducing the need for global IP addresses.


Static NAT (1-to-1)
-------------------
Map a single global IP address to a private IP address

Example is to map a global IP to a private IP honeypot, allowing honeypot to capture all global traffic


Port address translation NAT (1-to-1)
-------------------------------------
Map a single private address port to a global address port

Example is to forward traffic from global address port 80 to internal web server at private address port 80


NAT overload translation (port overloads)
-----------------------------------------
Allow multiple private addresses to access the internet through a single global IP address

This is used through overloading the port in the TCP segment, allowing the router to keep track of which private IP address to route incoming traffic back to

Typically used in home routers and widely used to reduce the need for global IPv4 addresses


Dynamic translation (NAT pool)
------------------------------
Map private IP addresses to a pool of global IP addresses, in a many-to-one relationship
