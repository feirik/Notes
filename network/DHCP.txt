Dynamic host configuration protocool (DHCP) allows a DHCP server to assign IP addresses automatially instead of statically (manually set).

The protocols uses UDP port 67 and 68 with mainly broadcast messages.


Process
*******
DHCP Discover
-------------
Host (DHCP client) with DHCP enabled sends DHCP Discover message - From IP 0.0.0.0 (unassigned IP) to 255.255.255.255 (broadcast)

DHCP Offer
----------
DHCP server responds with an offer for an IP in allowed pool of addresses - From DHCP server IP to 255.255.255.255 (broadcast)

Data includes client IP address, subnet mask, default gateway IP address, DNS IP address, IP lease time and DHCP server IP address.

DHCP Request
------------
DHCP client requests to be assigned to the client IP address - From IP 0.0.0.0 (unassigned IP) to 255.255.255.255 (broadcast)

DHCP Ack
--------
DHCP server acknowledges the IP assignement (lease) - From DHCP server IP to 255.255.255.255 (broadcast)

DHCP client can now communicate using its IP address on the network


Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA - DHCP not functioning)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Range: 169.254.0.1 - 169.254.254.255

If host is assigned address in this range, no DHCP server in network or malfunctioning DHCP server

Hosts sends out ARP request to check if selected APIPA address is in use


Lease time
----------
Default lease time is 24h, client asks for a renew of the lease after 50% of time has passed

If there are no available IP addresses from the pool, the DHCP server will fail to offer an IP
