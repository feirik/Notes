The purpose of a VLAN is to logically seperate broadcast domains on one switch, instead of using multiple physical switches.


Trunking (802.1Q)
-----------------
Trunking is used to connect multiple VLANs between switches over a single trunk interface (often high speed link)

The trunking process adds and removes a 12-bit VLAN portion to the Ethernet header (between source MAC and Type) to switch the frame to the correct VLAN


VLAN IDs (from 12-bit VLAN header)
----------------------------------
0 and 4095 are reserved

1-1005 is normal range

1006-4094 is extended range
