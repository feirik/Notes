The purpose of a switch is to forward or drop layer 2 frames based on destination MAC address.

Network control to avoid loops is handled by the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) or Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP, 802.1w)


MAC address table
-----------------
The MAC address table associates MAC addresses with interfaces connected to the switch, same for switch to switch traffic

The switch cache the MAC address table based on source MAC address of incoming frames

If switch is in doubt of an address table entry, it floods the frame to all interfaces


Spanning Tree Protocol (802.1D)
-------------------------------
Modes
*****
Root port
---------
Designated interface that is closest to the root device of the network

Designated port
---------------
Operational port on switch/bridge

Blocked port
------------
STP blocks port(s) to avoids loops in the network


States
******
Blocking
--------
Not forwarding to prevent a loop

Listening
---------
Not forwarding and cleaning MAC address table

Learning
--------
Not forwarding and adding to MAC address table

Forwarding
----------
Passes frames and is fully operational

Disabled
--------
Admin disabled port
