The purpose of the Domain Name System is to translate human-readable names into IP addresses.

DNS uses TCP/UDP port 53

DNS servers can be internal (intranet) or global (.com, .uk etc.)

Typical DNS providers are Google DNS (8.8.8.8) or Quad9 (9.9.9.9)


DNS query
---------
The DNS server recursively lookup the correct domain to IP translation and caches the result

Also possible to do manually iteratively (query DNS root server, get next step.)


Authority
---------
Authorative respose - DNS server is the authority for the zone

Non-authoriative - Server provided probably cached DNS information


Reverse DNS lookup
------------------
Provide DNS server with an IP address and get fully qualified domain name (FQDN) - Can be useful for OSINT


Zone transfer
-------------
Synchronize primary copy of the zone information to a secondary DNS server - Can be used for OSINT recon if not restricted
