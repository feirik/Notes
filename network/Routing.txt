The purpose of routers is to listen and provide subnet information to/from other routers

The router determines best path for sending the packet based on available info and routing protocol in use


Distance-vector routing
-----------------------
Choose route based on number of hops to target network (RIP, EIGRP)


Link-state routing
------------------
Choose route based on speed of the link (OSPF)


Hybrid-state routing
--------------------
Choose route based on link-state, distance-vector and network policies to decide route (BGP)


Routing table
-------------
Router, workstations and other devices who can forward packets have a route table

Default route/gateway of last resort - Send packet to this interface if no other specific route entries match

Often 0.0.0.0/0 Fa0/0 is used as a default route - Packets from any IP address with any subnet mask get sent to interface Fa0/0

Time to live (IPv4) and hop limit (IPv6) prevents packets looping, eventually dropping packets if no route is founds


Administrative distance
-----------------------
Determine which routing protocol has priority, in case of conflict between 2 or more protocols


Traffic shaping (QoS)
---------------------
Prioritize bandwidth usage based on ports
