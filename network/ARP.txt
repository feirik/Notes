The goal of ARP is to discover MAC address of a host, if only an IP address is known beforehand.

A known destination MAC address is necessary to transfer data over layer 2 Ethernet.

ARP is a protocol using both layer 2 (MAC) and 3 (IP).


ARP broadcast
-------------
If destination MAC address is not in sending host's ARP table, the host will send an 'ARP request' broadcast message to all other hosts in the broadcast domain.

If a receiving host's IP matches the broadcast query, it will send an unicast 'ARP reply' with its MAC address.


ARP table
---------
Typical timeout for ARP tables is 4-6 hours.

Static entries can be added to avoid having to send ARP requests/replies. Often used for VMs.


Commands Windows
----------------
arp -a (full ARP table)

arp -d * OR netsh interface ip delete arpcache (require elevated priveleges, clear ARP cache)


Commands Linux
--------------
arp -a
