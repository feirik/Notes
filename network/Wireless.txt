Encryption
**********
WEP
---
Bad practice - don't use

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)
----------------------------
Better than WEP, but worse encryption and password enforcement than WPA2

WPA2
----
Uses Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining (CCMP) and AES encryption, CBC-MAC for message integrity check (MIC)

Can be vulnerable to pre-shared key (PSK) brute-force from listening to 4-way handshake and capturing hash

WPA3
----
Galois Counter Mode Protocol, improved encryption compared to WPA2, GMAC as MIC

Uses a simulatneous authentication of equals (SAE) to avoid 4-way handshakes and brute-force attacks on hash


Service set identifier (SSID)
-----------------------------
Public wireless network name


Basic service set identifier (BSSID)
------------------------------------
MAC address of the wireless access point, multiple BSSIDs APs can use same extended (E)SSID to allow roaming between zones


Wi-fi channels
--------------
A channel is a group of frequencies to be used, numbered 1-11 (2.4Ghz) by IEEE

Channels 1-6-11 are not overlapping in the 2.4GHz range

Many more non-overlapping channels available for 5GHz, but can use multiple channels by increasing the bandwidth

802.11a/b/g has 20 MHz bandwidth, 802.11n has options 20/40/80, 802.11ac/ax has options 20/40/80/160MHz


Signal strength
---------------
Measured by Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) in dBm (decibels per milli Watt)

-50 dBm - Excellent
-70 dBm - Good
-80 dBm and lower - Low signal
