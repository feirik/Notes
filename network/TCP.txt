Transmission Control Protocol is a connection based delivery protocol for use across a network using TCP ports. (UDP and TCP can share a port number)

TCP first needs to establish a connection using a handshake, then it bi-directionally streams data across the connection and checks acknowledgements of data received.

TCP includes mechanisms for optimizing data transfer and data reliability by varying how often to ask for acks and potentially re-transmits if no ack is receivedmmma.

TCP data is guaranteed to come in order by the use of sequence numbers for the TCP segments.

Three-way handshake
*******************
SYN
---
Host sends a synchronization request

SYN+AKC
-------
Server/host responds with SYN+ACK, verifying that a TCP connection can be started (Stopping at this step is often used for stealth scanning)

ACK
---
Client acknowledges previous message and accepts the connection, can now send and receive on socket (IP:TCP port)

FIN
---
Initiate closing of the connection, with ACKing if FIN messages


Header (20 bytes minimum size - 65535 bytes maximum for TCP packet)
