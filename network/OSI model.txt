Bits  Frames Packets  Segments


Please Do Not Throw Sousage Pizza Away (Physical - Data Link - Network - Transport - Session - Presentation - Application)

Physical (layer 1)
------------------
Data transferred as bits over a medium (cable, fiber, wifi etc.)


Data Link (layer 2)
-------------------
MAC addresses for Ethernet, switching layer, ARP (also layer 3)


Network (layer 3)
-----------------
IP addresses, the routing layer, fragments data to traverse different networks


Transport (layer 4)
-------------------
TCP segment/UDP datagram, disassembles the segments into acceptable chunks for Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) limit

Firewall filtering lists


Session (layer 5)
-------------------
Start, stop, restart data transfer, tunneling protocols


Presentation (layer 6)
----------------------
Character encoding, encryption (SSL/TLS) - Often combined with application layer 7


Application (layer 7)
---------------------
What the user sees is the layer 7 application data - HTTP, FTP, DNS

Firewalls checking application data
