Ethernet is a layer 1-2 protocol often used in wireless (IEEE 802.11) or cabled (IEEE 802.3) applications.

Generally used as a LAN protocol.


MAC address (used for layer 2 addressing, abstraction to hardware)
------------------------------------------------------------------
MAC address is intended to be a set hardware address for a network interface card (NIC), but can be spoofed

Length is 6 octets, same as 12 bytes, or same as 48-bits

3 first octets represent Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) as manufacturer name

3 last octets is set by manufacturer, often an unique part or sequence number


More OUI
--------
LSB in first octet of the OUI code represents multicast (1) or unicast (0) for the NIC

2nd LSB in first octet of the OUI code represents locally administrered (1, overridden OUI, often VMs) or globally unique (0, OUI is used)


The Ethernet frame (Frame size 64-1522 bytes)
*********************************************
Preamble
--------
64-bit sequence of 01s to indicate start of frame

Destination MAC
---------------
48-bit MAC

Source MAC
----------
48-bit MAC

Tag identifiers (optional)
--------------------------
16-bits (Tag Protocol Identifier and Tag Control Information, used for some parts of the 802-protocols)

Type of data
------------
IPv4, IPv6 or ARP

Data
----
Payload carried by the frame, limited to maximum 1500 bytes for standard ethernet

Padding
-------
Pad data to make frame large enough for minimum size of 64 bytes for protocol

FCS
---
Frame check sequence (integrity checking, calculated during sending and recalculated during receiving to verify)
