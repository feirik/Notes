Administative distance for routes (if tie, uses route installed last)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Connected interface: 0
Static SD-WAN zone: 1
Static DHCP: 5
Static route: 10
Static IKE: 15
eBGP: 20
OSPF: 110
IS-IS: 115
RIP: 120
iBGP: 200


Default priority is 1 (used for differentiating active/standby routes)

Equal cost multi-path (ECMP) source IP mode is the default


Reverse path forwarding check
-----------------------------
set src-check enable (feasible path - non-strict mode enabled by default)


VDOM
----
By default, only root VDOM exists and is also the default management VDOM

Global settings in VDOM:
- Hostname
- HA settings
- FortiGuard settings
- System time
- Administrative accounts

By default, all VDOMs are in same broadcast domain

By default, no warning message appear when creating new VDOMs (possible to enable in CLI)


FSSO
----
Uses event ID 4768 and 4769 (FortiGate agentless polling domain controller)

Workstation verify intervall: 5 min (Check if user is still logged in)

Dead entry timeout interval: 480 min (entries with an unverified status)

IP address change verify intervall: 1 min (check if IP for user has changed)

FSSO log size limit: 10MB


SSL VPN
-------
Default port: 443 TCP

Default idle timeout: 300 sec

Default login timeout: 30 sec

Default DTLS hello timeout: 10 sec


IPsec VPN
---------
Dead peer detection: On demand is default mode

Hardware offloading is enabled by default

(H)ashing (SHA, MD5 etc.)
(A)uthentication (PSK, certificates, XAuth)
(G)roups (DH group selection)
(L)ifetime
(E)ncryption (AES128, AES192, AES256 etc., also DES-types, but not recommended)

IPsec add-route is enabled by default (automatic creation of static route in VPN tunnel)


High availability (HA)
**********************
NAT mode ethernet frame type: 0x8890

Transparent mode ethernet frame type: 0x8891

Data sync ethernet frame type: 0x8893

Election process
----------------
1. Number of monitored links being up
2. HA uptime
3. Priority
4. Serial number (larger is better)

Heartbeat interface address: 169.254.0.1 (highest serial number, x.x.x.2 for second highest etc.)

By default, cluster checks config every 60 seconds to check configurations are synced

If HA devices are out of sync, checksum of configs are checked every 15 sec

By default, multicast routes remain in forwarding table for 600 sec after HA failover

By default, only sessions subject to proxy inspection are distributed to secondary device in active-active mode

By default, uninterruptable upgrade is enabled


Diagnosis
*********
Green memory threshold default: 82%

Red memory threshold default: 88%

Extreme memory threshold default: 95%


Initial configuration
*********************
Default IP: 192.168.1.99

Default admin timeout: 5 min

Default config file format is without :, YAML is "config_system_global:" etc.


Firewall Policy
***************
Internet service database (ISDB) updates are enabled by default

Profile-based policy is default


Network address translation
***************************
Firewall address objects do not match VIPs (as in VIP is not denied if even if "all" is denied, would have to deny all and VIPs")

ARP reply from external VIP addresses is enabled by default


User authentication
*******************
Firewall policy must allow DNS and one of HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, Telnet to show user auth message

Default user setting timeout is idle (no traffic for amount of time locks out user)


Logging
*******
By default, logs older than 7 days are deleted from disk

25% of disk space is reserved system use

By default, oldest logs are overwritten on FortiAnalyzer if full disk

UDP Port 514 default for log transmission

Log rolling default size: 20MB


Certificate operations
**********************
Fortigate support the X.509v3


Web filter
----------
Rating error if timeout after is 15 sec by default

Default TTL for web filter cache is 60 min by default


Application control
-------------------
Default action for QUIC protocol is block


Antivirus
---------
Extended database is default (other is Extreme for some FG models)

Feature set is flow-based by default (hybrid mode of proxy and flow-based scanning of packets)

Default oversize limit is 10MB per file, if larger, file is by default allowed without scanning

By default, files will be attempted to be de-compressed 12 layers deep


IPS
---
The regular database is default, default action is block


Security fabric
---------------
By default, object sync is enabled between devices
