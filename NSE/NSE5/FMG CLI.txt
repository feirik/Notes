config system dns (set updated DNS IPs)

set primary <primary DNS ip>
set secondary <secondary DNS ip>

config system route (configure default gateway for default route (0.0.0.0/0))

edit 1 (set first route entry)

set device port<#> (connect route to port#)

set gateway <default gateway IP address to internet>

execute ping <FQDN like fortinet.com> (test DNS and internet connectivity for licensing)
