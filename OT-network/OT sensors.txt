Definitions
-----------
Continious monitoring (CM) - Focused on finding vulerabilities and risks

Network Security monitoring (NSM) - Focused on find threats and attackers (FW, sessions, NIDS/HIDS, Win logs, syslog, SNMP, AV agents etc.)

Signature-based - Based on IoCs

Anomaly-based - tools learn the network, then alert if something is different

Behavior-based - based on attacker TTPs


Top pain points for asset owners
--------------------------------
Lack of skills to operate OT cybersecurity solutions

Mitigation actions are not feasible

Creates alert fatigue

Too complicated to use

Effective only in a post-breach scenario

Alerts have no business context


Typical architecture (Claroty as example)
-----------------------------------------
xDome (SaaS with xIoT/IT functionality)
^
|
v
Enterprise management console (EMC) - Central management typically in SOC, NOC or data center similar to PAN Panorama or FortiManager
^
|
v
Continious threat detection (CTD) servers at each site - Can be multi-layered - Claroty SaaS also available
^
|
v
OT security sensors/Claroty edge (Using SPAN, RSPAN, ERSPAN or TAP data for the sensors)


Architecture (Nozomi)
---------------------
Customer hosted (on-prem or cloud) central management console (CMC) or SaaS (Nozomi Vantage)
^
|
v
Nozomi Guardian sensors (collecting and processing SPAN/TAP data)
^
|
v
Nozomi Remote Collector (collecting and feeding Guardian data)


High importance alerts
----------------------
Firmware update

Program mode change

Last program installed date


Alert types
***********
Asset information change
------------------------
Firmware, OS, hostname or slot cards changed unauthorized - Can be malicious or human error

Baseline inactive
-----------------
A configured baseline is not working as expected, can indicate operational issue or malicious activity

Configuration download to controller (PLC, RTU)
-----------------------------------------------
If unplanned - can indicate attacker trying to alter program or logic on controller 

Review configuration and code being uploaded if possible

Configuration upload from controller to EWS
-------------------------------------------
If unplanned - can indicated attacker trying to steal and enumerate data on the controller

Firmware download to controller (PLC, RTU)
------------------------------------------
EWS or software on PLC typically performs download, network traffic captures both old and new firmware

Potential attacks:
- Logic bomb attack timed
- Brick ethernet card
- Randomly timed attacks
- Field device propagation
- Laterally move to other field devices

Mode change
-----------
Different modes:
- Program - Must be enabled to make changes to program of device
- Run - Program upload and download disabled
- Remote - Allows for remote changes of mode
- Stop - PLC and program are stopped, outputs are set to off
- Reset - Reset PLC to original state, warm or cold reset (reset all I/O and registers)
- Test/Monitor mode - Similar to run but with more debug features

Potential malicious activity - Set controller to program or test/monitor in order to change logic

Monitor/debug mode
------------------
Unplanned activity might be malicious behavior

New asset
---------
New asset seen in network traffic, potentially MitM, newly plugged rogue device etc. if not planned

New conflict asset
------------------
New asset with same IP/MAC/other property as other asset, can be rogue device masking as legit device

Online edit
-----------
EWS or similar host trying to put controller in online edit mode (edit program while running), can be used to download or modify controller program

Policy rule match
-----------------
Communication matches an 'alert' rule configured in the OT sensor software (like an IDS FW rule)

Policy violation
----------------
Communication matches an alert by default rule in the OT sensor software (like an implicit deny FW rule)

Settings change
---------------
Setting change of a device such as TCP/IP setting

DCS configuration change
------------------------
Examples are DCS server starting on remote node, DCS stopped/started - Verify if planned or not

Denial of service
-----------------
Seen indications of DoS in traffic, such as SYN-flood

Failed login
------------
Incorrect credentials or adversary attempting password spray, brute force etc.

File system change
------------------
Detected editing or deleting of files from PLC file system

Host scan
---------
Single asset trying to reach multiple assets over the same port (e.g. EWS scanning devices port 80)

Approved scan? Common or uncommon port? Within or across subnet? From a known scanner IP?

Known threat alert
------------------
Traffic matches a known threat based on anamoly detection engine

Man-in-the-middle attack
------------------------
New host inserted in communication pathway to either monitor or alter network traffic

Memory reset
------------
Overwrite on controller (PLC, RTU) memory - Typically triggered by memory reset operation by configuration download

Port scan
---------
Device scanning multiple ports on other device

Suspicious activity
-------------------
Malformed packets, operational error, invalid sessions, unknown objects, protocol DDoS captured in network traffic

Suspicious file transfer
------------------------
File captured in traffic is known malicious by signature and/or contents
