FW basics
---------
R - Routing (know where traffic is headed, focus routing table)
N - NAT
R - Rights (Security policy ACCEPT/DENY rules, profiles etc.)


Routing
-------
get router info routing-table details <IP> (Show routing table entry that is used for IP)

get router info routing-table database (Show selected and not used entries in routing table)


ARP cache and MAC
-----------------
get system arp

get hardware nic <port#>


NAT debug
---------
get system session list (similar to netstat for seeing NAT translations etc.)


Status
------
get system status (serialnumber, version etc.)

get system performance status (performance utilization)


Upgrading
---------
1. Read the release notes
2. Have console access
3. Backup config
4. Know how to revert firmware partition
5. Have old and new firmware on hand
6. Read the release notes
7. After upgrade, run 'diag debug config-error-log read'


Troubleshooting
---------------
Don't trust the user info and documentation (but be nice)

Top-down or bottom-up troubleshooting

Verify symptom

Backup plan (before doing anything significant - snapshots snapshots)

Incremental testing


Bootstrapping from CLI
----------------------
get system interface physical (see status of interface ports)

config system interface

edit port<#>

show

set ip <ip> <mask in 255.255.255.0 format>

set allowaccess ping https ssh

end

execute ping <gateway IP> (check connectivity from interface)
