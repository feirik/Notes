Definitions
-----------
Continious monitoring (CM) - Focused on finding vulerabilities and risks

Network Security monitoring (NSM) - Focused on find threats and attackers (FW, sessions, NIDS/HIDS, Win logs, syslog, SNMP, AV agents etc.)

Signature-based - Based on IoCs

Anomaly-based - tools learn the network, then alert if something is different

Behavior-based - based on attacker TTPs


What to look for
----------------
Exceptions from baseline (A talks to B, but never normally to C)

Top talkers (C2, scanning etc.)

Unexpected connectivity (to internet or IT network)

Known malicious IPs and domains

Logins using default accounts

Error messages that could be correlated to vulns

Unusual system and firewall log entries

Endpoint, IDS or other security alerts

Unexpected file and firmware updates


PLC DFIR collection (ask engineers what they use in day-to-day to debug non-security events)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terminal

FTP

Web browser

PLC software


Collection best practice
------------------------
Have a plan, prepare in advance (checklist)

Document exactly what you collect

Dont make changes to or reboot PLC

Treat collected data as evidence

Assume attacker has access to PLC or HMI

Assume the ICS credentials are compromised


PLC collection points (Physical data)
*************************************
Location of device (exact)

Device description

Identifying info (manufacturer, S/N, P/N, name)

Connections (serial, USB, ethernet)

Front/back panel LED status

Power consumption

Temperature (if high, can indicate abnormal CPU usage)

Evidence of tampering


PLC collection points (Digital data)
************************************
System time and date (UTC or local)

Running configuration (including user accounts)

Last-known good config

RTOS version

Running firmware, approved firmware

CPU usage %, Memory usage % (RAM, storage)

Running processes

Active ports (serial, USB, ethernet etc.)

Logs (security, event, user logs)
