Ethernet Industial Protocol (Ethernet/IP) implements the common industrial protocol (CIP) in the Ethernet stack.

Ethernet/IP offers an object oriented framework for sending and receiving data in multiple Purdue-levels (mostly 2-3).

Ethernet/IP uses UDP for near real-time polling/reporting (implicit messaging) and TCP for control (explicit messaging - Change set point etc.)

TCP traffic and Ethernet/IP is often prioritized through QoS set in managed switches.


More TCP/IP like Protocols <------------------------> More specialized for real-time efficiency

EthernetIP, Modbus TCP --- Powerlink, Profinet RT --- Secros III, Profinet IRT, Ethercat


CIP Object model (Object-oriented protocol)
*******************************************
Node address
------------
IP address for Ethernet/IP (MAC address for DeviceNet, ControlNet and CompoNet)

Class ID
--------
Integer value representing object class

Instance ID
-----------
Integer value representing the object among all instances of same class

Attribute ID
------------
Integer value representing attribute assigned to class or instance, can hold data

Service code
------------
Function code to be sent to object or instance


An object can be required objects (Identity, Message Router etc.) or application objects (Analog Group, Discrete Group - Set by manufacturer)


Encapsulation header
********************
Command
-------
2 bytes

Length
------
2 bytes

Session handle
--------------
4 bytes

Status
------
4 bytes

Sender context
--------------
8 bytes

Options
-------
4 bytes

Command data
------------
0 to 65511 bytes


Security
********
Concerns
--------
No built in security in protocol

Common required CIP objects can assist attackers in enumeration and attacking a network more broadly

UDP and use of multicast enables spoofing and manipulation of transmission path from injected IGMP controls

Recommendations
---------------
Network segmentation into zones and conduits, explicitly whitelist Ethernet/IP nodes

Deep packet inspection firewall at zone perimiters

Passive monitoring using ICS-aware IPS
