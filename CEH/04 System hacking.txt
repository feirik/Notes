Overview ahead of hacking
-------------------------
Recon & Footprinting
- IP range
- Namespace
- Public Data

Scanning
- ID targets
- ID services
- ID O/S

Enumeration
- User lists
- Security flaws
- Resources


Password paths
--------------
Win: C:\windows\system32\config\sam

Win domain: NTDS - ntds.dit

Linux: /etc/shadow

OSX: /var/db/dslocal/nods/default/users/<user>.plist (ShadowHashData Property)


Privileges escalation
---------------------
DLL hijacking

CPU vulnerabilities

Offline access

Access Token

Application Shimming

Filesystem Permission weakness

Path interception (pass in dll in path of another used by application)

Scheduled tasks


Clearing tracks
---------------
Clear browser history

Delete cookies

Delete downloads

Clear password manager

Delete private data

Clear logs (correct way, not just leave clear log entry)

regedit > HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE > Software > Microsoft - Microsoft Management Console > CurrentVersion > Explorer > Delete all entries but default (deletes all recently opened document entries)

Advanced
--------
Disable auditing
- auditpol for Windows, lower log size to overwrite, change log file path
- HISTSIZE=0 for bash_history, history -c (clear history), history -w (deletes history of current shell)
- cat /dev/null > ~.bash_history && history -c && history exit (clears for this shell and other shell)
- shred ~/.bash_history (overwrites file memory)

Do things

Re-enable auditing
